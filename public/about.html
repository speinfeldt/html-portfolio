<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Registered Nurse turned developer. My passion for problem solving and building lead me to want to learn how to code. 
  I find coding very rewarding. It is a great feeling to see a project compleated that works well and looks great.

<p>The outdoors is where I find my fun. Mountains and beaches are healing to the soul. Give me a beach chair in the sun 
  watching and listening to the waves or a seat around a campfire in the mountains and I am in my happy place.</p>

<p>Family is the purpose for everything. I am a mother of 3 beautitiful kids who keep me on my toes. Motherhood is the 
  most amazing thing I could ever do.
